How it works:
The Account class represents a bank account and provides methods for depositing, withdrawing, transferring money, and checking the balance.
The Bank class handles all operations related to account management, including creating accounts and listing account details.
The program runs in a loop, displaying the menu until the user chooses to exit.


Running the code:
To run the code, you can copy and paste it into a Python script file, then run the file in your Python environment.
